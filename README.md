An API with both GET and POST endpoints to add to our already existing Happy Thoughts project. This project taught us how to set up and use POST requests and Mongo to store data in our database, and display this data on our frontend.

## The problem

I found this project pretty easy and I really enjoy backend projects, so I wanted to challenge myself by also creating a feature that would make it possible to delete messages. I also wanted users to be able to identify themselves by their names, so I added a name property to my Mongoose schema.
